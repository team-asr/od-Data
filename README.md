od-Data repo hosts aerial imagery and associated artifacts including:
a. raw aerial images
b. Processed images.
c. Analytics of the images e.g. vegetation indecies, terrain maps, etc
d. Flight plans and flight maps

## Usage
To use the data herein, you need photogrametry software, such as the OpenDrone Map application suite, : https://github.com/team-asr/WebODM
We've included a toolkit to extract image metadata, in the folder ImageMetadata (https://github.com/team-asr/od-Data/tree/master/ImageMetadata). Visit the folder to find
invocation instructions. The toolkit is developed using the Java programming language and a working knowledge of the language isn't required.

We've been testing out algorithms that can be invoked independently with python installed, on the folder algorithms (https://github.com/team-asr/od-Data/tree/master/algorithms). Invocation instructions
can be found therein. A working knowledge of python is assumed.

## Note
Some of the data will become available as they are uploaded by the team.

A link is being created to facilitate updates from the main server directly available to the ASR website, as these are done immediately as missions occur.
